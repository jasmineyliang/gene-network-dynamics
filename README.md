## DREAM Challenge Assessment
- Analyze the results from an internal DREAM challenge comparing implementations based on ROC and precision-recall curves.
- Discuss contradictory results and identify the best-performing method.

## Boolean Network Models
1. Analyze a Boolean regulatory network model of 3 genes.
2. Express update rules in logical form.
3. Draw the wiring diagram highlighting positive and negative interactions.
4. Find the Derrida value of the network.
5. Describe activation and degradation propensities for a stochastic discrete dynamical system.
6. Calculate phenotypical robustness of the SDDS.
7. Discuss the lowest possible value for the phenotypical robustness of probabilistic Boolean networks.
